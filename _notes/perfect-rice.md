In all seriousness, I cook perfect steamed rice on the stove every time. The 
haters doubt me but they're suprisingly quiet after they've tried it. After a 
recent growth in demand for my rice process, I've decided to post it here for 
all my one reader.

## The Ratio

The big question is the ratio so I'll leave that at the top of the page here.
For 1 part rice, add anywhere between 1.25 and 1.5 parts water depending on how 
flaky you like your rice (1.25 is flakier but don't go lower than this or it 
won't cook through).

## Materials

* Stove
  * I've used this process extensively on induction and electric hobs. It will 
  not work on gas hobs without modifications (see below).
* Stovepot and a lid, ideally glass
  * Glass lid is beneficial so you can watch the water come to a boil and know 
  when to turn the heat down. If you don't have a glass lid, I'd suggest a bit 
  more water (maybe 10%) for the first times as you get accustomed to how long
  it takes to boil.
* Scale (can use a glass or mug as alternative)
  * The water:rice ratio can be done by weight or by volume. I prefer weight for 
  simplicity and accuracy, however eyeballing with a mug or glass will work 
  just as fine.
* Rice
  * I typically use a longer grained rice such as jasmine or basmati, however 
  I've also followed this process for short grained and sushi rice with success.


## Detailed Process

First, put some water in the kettle and turn it on. You'll only need about 1.25x 
the amount of water as rice, so you shouldn't need much in the kettle.

While the kettle is boiling, measure out the rice. This is best done by adding 
directly to the pot on a scale and noting how many grams you'd like (75g per 
portion is what the label will likely say, but go with your heart). If you don't
have a scale, you can first pour the rice into a mug or glass to note where the 
fill line is.

Now fill the pot with water and begin stirring the rice around to wash off the 
starch. Pour the water out carefully and repeat at least 2 more times (or until 
the water runs clear).

Make sure you've drained as much water as possible, although a sieve won't be 
necessary just do your best with tilting the pot. Hopefully the kettle has just 
finished boiling and now you can add the hot water to the rice - don't forget to 
measure how much you add.

Go for between 1.25x and 1.5x the amount of water as there is rice. This can be 
done in grams/ml of water and rice interchangably, although I usually see better
results when measured by weight.

Note: 1ml of water is 1g.

| *Rice*        | *Water*      |
| :------------ | -------------: |
| \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- | \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- |
| 75g | 94 - 113g |
| 1 mug | 1.25 - 1.5 mugs |

Now put the pot on the stove on maximum high heat and cover with a lid. Keep a 
close eye on it as it will likely only take a couple minutes to reach a boil.

I'll describe the 3 stages of the water boiling and then explain why:
1. The water is steaming, a soft boil like you'd use for a poached egg.
2. The water is lightly bubbling, a clear and definite boil.
3. The water is bubbling lots, starting to even bubble ontop due to the starch.
Equivalent to a rolling boil.

What you want to do is catch it exactly at #2 and turn the heat immediately to 
the lowest setting your hob has. Set a timer for 15 minutes and leave the pot
covered during this time.

After 15 minutes, you can check that it's cooked through now by tilting the pot,
you shouldn't see any water pool at the edge as it should all be absorbed by the
rice. At this point, take it off the element and leave it to rest covered for a 
few more minutes. This step can be skipped if you're in a rush, but the rice 
will dry out quicker.

After a few minutes resting, fluff the rice with a fork and serve. You should 
have perfect steamed rice.


## Recipe

This takes about 20 minutes from start to finish. The process is as follows

1. Boil water in the kettle.
2. While water is boiling, *measure*, wash, and drain your rice.
3. Add the boiled water, cover, and immediately place on stove on high.
4. Once the water is at a rolling boil, reduce to low and leave covered for 15min.
5. After 15min, remove from element and let sit for a few minutes.
6. Fluff with a fork and serve.


## Further Notes

### Gas Hobs

I struggle here honestly. If you know a good process for this then please 
let me know. 

The issue here is because a gas burner's lowest setting is usually still too hot
and the rice will burn. I have multiple ideas for this but not enough practice
to suggest any one. Things to try include:

* Ommitting the inital high heat until boil and just beginning 15min timer.
* Turning the element off before the complete 15min, but still allowing to rest 
for this time.
* Use a tea towel under the lid and turn off the element completely.
  * This is something I read in a recipe once. I think the idea is that the tea 
  towel will block the steam from escaping through the vent hole in the lid, and 
  thus once it's reached a boil you can turn off the burner and the pot should 
  have enough latent heat to complete the rice. I imagine this will be heavily 
  varied by size and thickness of your pot as well as quantity of rice.
