I haven't found a way that makes the trains for this trip a dream, but alas here
is the best I've found.

## The Plan

### Getting to Corrour

There are a few options to arrive at Corrour Saturday morning. Let's go through
them

1. Leave Friday after work, take the train all the way, and camp near the 
  station or Loch Ossian. 

    > **Bonus:** Sleep at the Youth Hostel and keep the tent dry.
  
    - 17:31 - 18:18: Train from Edinburgh Waverly to Glasgow Queen Street.
    - 18:23 - 21:20: Train from Glasgow Queen Street to Corrour.

    This does get you in pretty late for setting up camp, so hopefully you're 
    comfortable with that or (better yet) managed to secure a bed at the hostel.
    Alternatively, you can get off earlier: 20:20 at Crianlarich, camp there, 
    and then catch the first train (07:48) from there to Corrour in the morning.

2. Leave Saturday morning.

    - 07:15 - 08:08: Train from Edinburgh Waverly to Glasgow Queen Street.
    - 08:21 - 11:21: Train from Glasgow Queen Street to Corrour.

    This sounds pretty ideal, but starting walking at mid day might not be 
    the best for your situation.

3. Leave (early!) Saturday morning.

    - 04:50 - 08:58: Caledonian sleeper train from Edinburgh Waverly to Corrour.

    If you're particularly skilled at catching some shut eye on the train, maybe 
    this option is most appealing to you. Otherwise, forget I included it.


## The walk to Dalwhinnie

This route is 38km and can be easily viewed on 
[plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/2658850). 

If you feel energetic, there should be time to scramble up a hill or two,
although I haven't noticed any obvious trails for it.


## Getting back to Edinburgh

This part you can also get creative. The easiest, and latest, option is to catch 
the only direct train:

- 19:54 - 22:15: Train Dalwhinnie to Edinburgh Waverly.

With this option you could likely grab some food from the Snack Shack if they're
open while you're waiting around. This is a nice backup to have, but my 
preferred option is the following:

- 16:22 - 16:37: Train Dalwhinnie to Kingussie.
- 17:20 - 19:03: Train from Kingussie to Dunblane (Scotrail for Glasgow Queen 
Street).
- 19:10 - 20:07: Train from Dunblane to Edinburgh Waverly.

Although this sounds like much more a hassle, it gets you home earlier and more 
importantly, gives you 40min in Kingussie to grab some food for the train. There
are more options here, including the good ol reliable Co-op just 5mins from the 
train station.
