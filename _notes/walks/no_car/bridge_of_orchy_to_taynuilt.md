## The Plan

### Getting to Bridge of Orchy

There are a few options to arrive at Bridge of Orchy Saturday morning. Let's go 
through them

1. Leave Friday after work and go all the way, camp around Bridge of Orchy and 
wake up Saturday already in walking mind. This involves an early departure from
Edinburgh (I'm sorry to those with a strict 9-5, you may have to sneak out early
for this option). The transport is as follows:
  - 17:05 - 18:00: Train from Edinburgh Waverly to Stirling.
  - 18:15 - 19:46: Bus from Stirling to Tyndrum (978 to Oban).
  - 19:55 - 20:06: Bus from Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy (914 to Fort William).

   Depending on which time of year you do this, you'll hopefully have a couple 
   hours of daylight left to find and setup your camp spot for the night.

2. If you don't like the risk of walking with a wet tent on Saturday or a 25min 
   later departure would be really helpful to you, you can look at staying in 
   the Crianlarich Youth Hostel on Friday night (pending availability). This 
   would then work out as:
   - 17:30 - 18:18: Train from Edinburgh Waverly to Glasgow Queen Street.
   - 18:23 - 20:07: Train from Glasgow Queen Street to Crainlarich (Scotrail for 
     Oban).
   - Stay the night in the Crainlarich Youth Hostel.
   - 08:14 - 08:42: Bus from Crainlarich to Bridge of Orchy (916 to Uig).

3. I struggle to sleep on a train, so that's why this final option is last for 
   me. That said, it does enable leaving Saturday - just a bit early.
   - 04:50 - 08:17: Caledonian Sleeper train from Edinburgh Waverly to Bridge of
     Orchy.

## The walk to Taynuilt

This route is 42km and can be easily viewed on 
[plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/2644055?units=km). This isn't
my original route, I've just exported it to plotaroute so I could share it 
easily.

The route follows the WHW to start and quickly diverts onto a cycle path for the
remainder of the journey. It goes past the Clasgour Hut to then follow Glen 
Kinglass all the way to Loch Etive. From here, the route continues alongside the 
loch until finishing in Taynuilt.


## Getting back to Edinburgh

There are earlier options if you want to get home earlier. With that said, if 
you'd like to maximize your walking time here is the option:

- 18:33 - 21:20: Train from Taynuilt to Glasgow Queen Street.
- 21:30 - 22:19: Train from Glasgow Queen Street to Edinburgh Waverly.

Perhaps the biggest hiccup here is that there is only one option for food in 
Taynuilt and that's Graham's Grocers. It's well rated on Google Maps and says 
it should be open until 22:00 on a Sunday, but sometimes small town businesses 
don't necessarily abide by the Google Maps.

Note: If you arrive in Taynuilt early and hungry, you could always get the first
train/bus to Oban and get food/drink there until the train leaves from Oban to 
Glasgow.
