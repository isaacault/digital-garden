## Preface

There are a lot of factors that go into planning a walk, and especially when
trying to find a walk that can be done by public transport the time spent 
planning increases significantly. Hopefully by sharing routes that I've chosen,
I might introduce somebody to a walk they hadn't thought accessible before.

## Overview

Lairig Ghru is a well known hill pass which crosses through the central 
Cairngorms. With many ways to enter and exit Lairig Ghru, here I will outline 
how to do it over a weekend from Scotland's central belt via public transit.

## The Route

From Braemar to Aviemore, this route is 42km and can be easily viewed on 
[plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/2611350?units=km). This route 
is also used each year for the 
[Lairig Ghru Race](https://www.deesiderunners.com/races/lairig-ghru-race/), so 
there are multiple versions online and one should be careful to not interfere 
with the race weekend.

## The Plan

I said this is a weekend plan and it is, so here's how.

### Friday

**18:10:** Leave for Edinburgh Waverly, probably grab a meal deal on the way.<br>
**18:35 - 21:13:** Take the LNER from Waverly to Aberdeen.<br>
**21:13 - 21:28:** Walk to the Premier Inn Aberdeen City Centre.<br>

Sleep in Aberdeen.

### Saturday

**07:05 - 07:16:** Walk to Union Square<br>
**07:16 - 09:27:** Bus to Braemar. This involves a bus change at Golf Road.<br>
**09:27:** Begin day 1 of the walk. Camp anywhere along the way.<br>

### Sunday

Continue the walk. <br>
**19:34 - 22:15:** Take the Scotrail from Aviemore to Edinburgh Waverly.<br>

Rest, and go back to work on Monday feeling relaxed.

## The Cost

In theory you could probably camp streetside somewhere in Aberdeenshire to 
reduce the cost, but a Premier Inn is only £51 and you can split that with 
someone if you have a friend willing to walk with you.

I booked my trains 1 week in advance and got them for £39pp, or £26pp with a 
16-25 railcard. 

## Variations

There are many train options here. For starters, the biggest variation one might 
make is leaving straight from Edinburgh on Saturday morning. With a 06:30 train,
you could be at the route start point at 11:37, which for many would be plenty 
of time for this route.

Similarly, there are plenty of earlier trains from Aviemore back down, so 
getting home earlier is always an option. I chose the late train so I can have 
time to enjoy the walk and maybe add some spontaneous munros, or maybe get some
Sunday dinner at the [Old Bridge Inn](https://www.oldbridgeinn.co.uk/).
