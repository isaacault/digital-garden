## Preface

There are a lot of factors that go into planning a walk, and especially when
trying to find a walk that can be done by public transport the time spent 
planning increases significantly. Hopefully by sharing routes that I've chosen,
I might introduce somebody to a walk they hadn't thought accessible before.

## Overview

Lairig Ghru is a well known hill pass which crosses through the central 
Cairngorms. With many ways to enter and exit Lairig Ghru, here I will outline 
how to do it over a weekend from Scotland's central belt via public transit.

## The Route

From Braemar to Aviemore, this route is 42km and can be easily viewed on 
[plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/2611350?units=km). This route 
is also used each year for the 
[Lairig Ghru Race](https://www.deesiderunners.com/races/lairig-ghru-race/), so 
there are multiple versions online and one should be careful to not interfere 
with the race weekend.

## The Plan

I said this is a weekend plan and it is, so here's how.

### Friday

**18:10:** Leave for Edinburgh Waverly, probably grab a meal deal on the way.<br>
**18:35 - 21:13:** Take the LNER from Waverly to Aberdeen.<br>
**21:13 - 21:28:** Walk to the Premier Inn Aberdeen City Centre.<br>

Sleep in Aberdeen.

### Saturday

**07:05 - 07:16:** Walk to Union Square<br>
**07:16 - 09:27:** Bus to Braemar. The maps say that this involves a bus change 
at Golf Road, however you are meant to just stay on the same bus.<br>
**09:27:** Begin day 1 of the walk. Camp anywhere along the way.<br>

### Sunday

Continue the walk. <br>
**19:34 - 22:15:** Take the Scotrail from Aviemore to Edinburgh Waverly.<br>

Rest, and go back to work on Monday feeling relaxed.

## The Cost

In theory you could probably camp streetside somewhere in Aberdeenshire to 
reduce the cost, but a Premier Inn is only £51 and you can split that with 
someone if you have a friend willing to walk with you.

I booked my trains 1 week in advance and got them for £39pp, or £26pp with a 
16-25 railcard. 

## Variations

There are many train options here. For starters, the biggest variation one might 
make is leaving straight from Edinburgh on Saturday morning. With a 06:30 train,
you could be at the route start point at 11:37, which for many would be plenty 
of time for this route.

Similarly, there are plenty of earlier trains from Aviemore back down, so 
getting home earlier is always an option. I chose the late train so I can have 
time to enjoy the walk and maybe add some spontaneous munros, or maybe get some
Sunday dinner at the [Old Bridge Inn](https://www.oldbridgeinn.co.uk/).

## Update: Afterwards

This all went very smoothly! Our bus leaving Union Square in Aberdeen was about 
30min late, but since it's the same bus all the way to Braemar this had little 
impact on the remainder of the journey. 

In Braemar, there was a Co-op which we used for trail snacks, but sadly we 
caught them on the last day before permanent closure. There is also a blue
Scottish Water Top Up Tap in the village center, so no need to worry about 
filling up with the Premier Inn water (also this water tasted much better).

The weekend we went was the first warm and sunny weekend of the year, so the
trails and the Corrour Bothy were busy. Extra busy at the bothy. We planned to 
wild camp anyways, but fair warning this route doesn't involve many obvious camp 
spots between Luibeg Burn - I guess that's all part of the fun though. Along the
River Dee there were a few bends that had small beaches for one or two tents, 
which gave us a great place and a great sleep, but aside from those there were
few appealing options.

As expected, the Old Bridge Inn food was very welcomed.

I definitely recommend this route! Thoroughly enjoyed.
