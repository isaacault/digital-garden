A couple weeks ago, Grammy nominated American rapper Schoolboy Q released his 
sixth studio album, Blue Lips.

I've been listening modern day hip hop, aka rap, for about a decade now and 
Schoolboy Q has been no exception to that. I even saw Mr. Q live in 2016, the 
day before he released his fourth album, Blank Face LP. I thoroughly enjoyed 
that album, listening to it all summer with my friends, buying the CD, and 
even revisiting it on occasion to this day.

So, why did I feel completely uninterested while listening to Blue Lips?

I'd like to get one thing out of the way, this isn't a post about how I used to 
love an artist and now they've released a sub-par album that didn't impress me.
That's happened many times in the past and is just part of being over-invested 
in what an artist has to offer for you.

No, this is a stream of consciousness inspired post where I'm trying to wrap my 
mind around how rather than just being unimpressed, I was specifically 
*uninterested*.

What exactly is this difference I'm picking hairs between? I mean to say that 
not only did this album not deliver any jolts of excitement inside me to 
consider myself pleased with it, I also didn't really care or feel invested to 
find these rushes of pleasure. To many this may sound like I'm going in circles,
but for me this is something that's picking at the back of my mind, something 
I can't let go of because although uninterested, *I actually thought the album 
was good.*

Before I sound crazy, hear me out. Blue Lips ticked plenty of boxes to be a 
good album; it had catchy songs, bass heavy songs, lyrically emphasized songs, 
the productions, mixing, and rapping throughout was good. I don't mean to say 
anything negative about Blue Lips, I just wasn't interested by it.

If your confused at this point, then you're starting to understand what's 
been picking at me.

You see, this is a dramatic instance of something that's been happening to me 
more and more lately. An artist I used to love releases an album, I listen to 
it once or twice, and as if it never entered my life it leaves and I go back to 
listening to whatever I've been on lately[^1]. Meanwhile, each time it happens I'm
reminded of all these confident assertions I made to myself as a teenager. 
Things like, 

[^1]: I promise you don't want to hear about all the ambient I've been rinsing
      through my ears lately.

> *Hip hop will never die for me, I'll be listening and keeping up forever.*
>
> *How could anybody not find this the best music ever? It's incredible on so 
> many levels.*
>
> *Finding and listening to hip hop is one of the greatest things I do in my 
> day, and I never want to stop.*

Yes, these are dramatic, that's how things were (are) inside my head. The 
fact is, each time I feel uninterested by a new album from an artist I once 
loved, I feel a little more disconnected from the person I was up until my mid 
twenties. 

The thing is that I still enjoy hip hop, just not being bored by hip hop. Is 
popular hip hop boring these days? Or am I being bored by popular hip hop? I'm
sure genres go through growth periods and then also recess into more stagnant 
eras, and maybe hip hop is just waiting for somebody to take it's sound in a 
different direction. Alternatively, maybe my taste has changed? Surely enough 
that's bound to happen and I can't expect artists to change their sound to keep 
up with my taste. Lots of thoughts and ideas to sit with, and I think I'll 
need to sit with them some more to get anywhere useful.
