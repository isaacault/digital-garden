# Preface

Given the amount of time I've spent obsessing over UL content, I'm not going to 
lie to myself that this will be anything near a one and done topic. I intend to 
write about the UL philosophy, how to lighten your load, what I've learned about 
various pieces of kit, and how UL intersects with day-to-day life.

I won't be reviewing any products, as most things I have are the first of such 
items to me. That said, with my ability to ramble, I'm sure the above topics 
will give me plenty to write on.

# The Philosophy

Like any philosophy, it has multiple interpretations and multiple realisations.
First I'll lay a couple definitions.

> **Base Weight**: The weight of your bag with everything in it, except for the 
> clothes you will wear while walking and any consumables (food/drink).
> 
> **Ultralight Backpacking**: A form of backpacking where the base weight is 
> minimised as much as feasibly possible. A base weight of less than 
> 10lbs/4.5kgs is often discussed as the upper threshold, but really it is 
> dependent on person/place (more about this later).

The next thing I'll address is, why? Why reduce base weight as much as you can? 
This is where different people may have different reasons, and they can have 
any combination or amount of the reasons. Let me explain:


## Comfort

This is the first reason you'll find, the one everybody will claim, and perhaps 
the easiest to grasp. Historically, and also habitually as we go backpacking for 
the first time, backpackers will pack huge bags with everything they could 
possibly need for a comfortable excursion. This is also where a lot of people 
turn away, as to many this implies that ultralight backpacking is about giving 
up comfort - it's not. Ultralight backpacking is about maximising your walking 
comfort while minimising the impact on your camping comfort. 

Regardless of how short or long your excursion is, if you're spending every day 
walking with all of your gear on your back, then there comes a point where 
adding comfort while camping is taking away more comfort while walking. I'm not 
to try to logically prove this statement, but please take it as the truth and 
reason we don't go camping with our entire bed matress on our backs. 

If, for each item, we evaluate how much comfort it provides and how much 
discomfort it creates, we're one step closer to lightening our packs, which can 
make your entire trip more enjoyable.

## Ease

I originally had this grouped in with comfort, but it deserves it's own reason. 
Everyone has their own reasons to go backpacking, and for some the reason is 
merely to extend the walk. For me, I really like walking up and down hills, 
which I'm not sure I'm able to do with a heavy bag. I'm hoping to one day 
lighten my gear enough that I can go on multi day walks with 1000m gain or more
while carrying my tent and everything.


## Minimalism

I'm not going to try to dissect why minimalism is something in itself that draws
people, but for the same reasons the minimalism while trekking is equally 
pleasing. This doesn't just apply to the practice, but also to the theory and 
realising that different items can serve multiple purposes, thus minimising 
your overall kit.


## Hobby Toys

I'm guilty. There is so much satisfaction is seeing a product designed so 
perfectly for it's use case. Engineering beyond the simple requirement of "a" 
backpack and converging towards "the" backpack, or any other item. It's quite 
pleasing to many to see these new designs and admire the thought put into them.
