I just got back from a week in Orkney, an archipelago[^1] off the north coast of
Scotland. I went with my partner who was on holiday and I worked remotely during
the week from our accommodation in Stromness on the main island.

[^1]: I just learned this word last week and am keen to use it as much as I can.

## Accommodation

We stayed in a truly lovely [1-bedroom self contained contemporary croft](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/50486715?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=9ce8b5ab-787d-427d-8ad0-f69fdc51cd9e)

I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone. It was lovely and so were the 
hosts. If you ever find yourself planning a trip to Orkney and choose to not 
book this place, allow me to suggest that you search for something similarly 
cozy and comfortable, because you may find youself looking to spend more time 
than originally planned inside ...

## Weather

Ah yes, Mother Nature's expression of emotion. You know what they say, 

> There's no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.

I'm in firm agreement with this, and I will get out of the way early that I did
forget to pack my waterproof trousers. Now, with that out of the way, *it was 
wet and windy*. It didn't stop us from going outside, but it certainly didn't 
discourage us from staying inside lots either.

## Trip Highlights

I'm this far and already feeling unmotivated to finish this so I'm going to 
be quick on this. I had a very relaxing week in the islands and that was all 
I was hoping for, so mission accomplished. Now, in addition to that, here are 
my personal highlights

* **NorthLink Ferry breakfast**. This was my first time on a NorthLink ferry. I 
  went in on the breakfast buffet and as an avid bean enjoyer I didn't hold back
  on that front. My enjoyment of this breakfast was worth the looks I got for 
  having such a prominent ratio of beans on my tray. 
* **Swans in the sea**. I didn't know they did that? A small loch on a peaceful 
  walk is where I typically expect to see swans, but these Orkney swans were 
  quite content in the sea bobbing up and down with the waves. 
* **Pickled cucumber**. I got some from an honesty box and it was my first time 
  having it before. I enjoyed.
* **Loganair Orkney Inter-Island Service**. Being the achipelago[^1] that it is,
  it should come as no surprise that there are regular and affordable ferrys. 
  What was surprising was the regular and affordable inter-island flights, which 
  we took on a trip to North Ronaldsay, a 15 minute flight with 8 people. The 
  pilot recognised that there were non-locals on the plane and was visibly 
  annoyed when this meant that he had to give the safety speech (it took all of 
  30 seconds). He buttered it both ways though 10/10 would recommend.
* **North Ronaldsay Sheep**. Not interacting with them, and not eating them 
  either, but merely learning about them and their history is quite interesting.
  As industry shifted from kelping to farming, the islanders built a six foot 
  wall all around the island to keep the sheep from ruining the crofts. These 
  sheep then evolved to survive off seaweed and now they're extra sensitive to 
  copper poisoning because of it. Wild.

Alright. This one didn't roll out as easily, but I'm trying to be consistent 
with writing. Time for dinner.
